title: "Business Data Analyst | Analytics + Problem Solving"
---

I turn ambiguous commercial questions into decision-ready analysis—combining structured thinking with hands-on analytics (SQL, ML, optimization, and unstructured data).

### Focus areas
- **Commercial problem solving:** diagnose growth, channel, and pricing opportunities with data
- **Hypothesis-driven analytics:** frame the problem, test assumptions, and quantify impact
- **Analytics engineering (SQL):** build clean data models, reusable metrics, and reporting-ready tables
- **Applied ML:** predictive + explainable models that support business decisions
- **Optimization & scenario planning:** translate constraints and trade-offs into clear options
- **Executive communication:** concise insights, recommendations, and next steps for stakeholders

Most projects include reproducible code and a short write-up so the logic and results are easy to review.
